# Chatbot AI - Proof of Concept (PoC)

A simple chatbot builder proof of concept designed to help companies and B2B products quickly create and deploy AI-powered chatbots.

---

## Overview

This project started as a PoC about 2 months ago to create a more **scalable** and **flexible** chatbot platform. Previously, my team had built a chatbot tailored for a single project, but it wasnâ€™t efficient or reusable across different use cases. This PoC aims to address those limitations by providing a foundation to build customizable chatbots.
