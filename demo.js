**MongoDB Query:** 
\`\`\`javascript
db.users.countDocuments({})
\`\`\`

**Suggestions:** This will return the total count of all user documents. If you want to count users with specific criteria, you can add conditions inside the countDocuments() method.`,

        "price greater": `**Understanding:** You're looking for products that have a price higher than a specific value.

**MongoDB Query:** 
\`\`\`javascript
db.products.find({ price: { $gt: 100 } })
\`\`\`

**Suggestions:** This query finds all products with price greater than 100. You can adjust the number or add additional filters like category or availability.`,

        "new york": `**Understanding:** You want to find all users who are located in New York.

**MongoDB Query:** 
\`\`\`javascript
db.users.find({ city: "New York" })
\`\`\`

**Suggestions:** This will return all users where the city field exactly matches "New York". For case-insensitive search, you can use regex: { city: /new york/i }`,

        "categories": `**Understanding:** You want to see the different categories available in the products collection.

**MongoDB Query:** 
\`\`\`javascript
db.products.distinct("category")
\`\`\`

**Suggestions:** This will return an array of unique category values. You can also use aggregation for more complex grouping operations.`

**MongoDB Query:** 
\`\`\`javascript
// Based on your question, here's a suggested approach:
db.collection.find({ /* your query criteria */ })
\`\`\`

**Suggestions:** Please provide more specific details about what you're looking for, and I can generate a more targeted MongoDB query.`;
